# Sandclock V2 

ðŸªƒ **Sandclock V2** ðŸªƒ is a set of yield strategies on mainnet, implemented as [ERC4626-compliant](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) tokenized vaults. 

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lindy-labs/sandclock-contracts/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/lindy-labs/sandclock-contracts)

## Strategies
- **scWETH** - Deposit WETH/ETH and have it enter a leveraged staked ETH position with additional borrow/supply returns. Receive scWETH shares which appreciate over time when the vault is profitable and can be redeemed for WETH. A keeper bot regularly rebalances the position against a target loan to value ratio in order to compound profits or de-risk position. Strategy has exposure to [Lido finance](https://lido.fi/), [Curve stETH-ETH LP](https://classic.curve.fi/steth/risks), [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/), [Aave V3](https://docs.aave.com/risk/) and the [Chainlink stETH/ETH](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-eth/steth-eth) price feed.
- **scUSDC** - Deposit USDC and over-collateralize it against WETH which will be deposited into scWETH strategy. Receive scUSDC shares which appreciate over time when the vault is profitable and can be redeemed for USDC. A keeper bot regularly rebalances the position against a target loan to value ratio in order to compound profits or de-risk position. Strategy has exposure to scWETH, [Aave V3](https://docs.aave.com/risk/), [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/), [Uniswap V3](https://uniswap.org/) and the [Chainlink USDC/ETH](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/usdc-eth) price feed.

## Staking contracts
The yield strategies takes a performance fee which is distributed to Sandclock Quartz holders thru a set of staking contracts deployed on mainnet. These contracts additionally distributes bonus multiplier points (inspired by [GMX reward mechanism](https://gmxio.gitbook.io/gmx/rewards)) in order to incentivize long term staking.

- **RewardTracker** - Deposit Quartz and recieve sfQuartz. You can also deposit bnQuartz. Over time, as performance fees are collected, you can claim WETH rewards in relation to the amount of sfQuartz you own and how many bnQuartz you've deposited. sfQuartz can be redeemed for Quartz at a 1:1 ratio at any time. On redemption, bnQuartz will be burned relative to the amount you redeem. Contracts are inspired and built on top of the [Playpen ERC20StakingPool](https://github.com/ZeframLou/playpen/blob/main/src/ERC20StakingPool.sol) contracts.
- **BonusTracker** - Deposit sfQuartz and recieve sQuartz. Over time you can claim bnQuartz at a 100% APR. sQuartz can be redeemed for sfQuartz at a 1:1 ratio at any time.
- **StakingRouter** - Provides a single user interfacing contract that routes between the different staking contracts. Deposit Quartz and receive sQuartz. Provides user with option to claim WETH rewards, compound bonus multiplier points and redeem sQuartz for Quartz.
