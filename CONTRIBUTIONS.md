## Contributing to the Codebase
As a contributor to our codebase, we expect you to follow established conventions and best practices to maintain consistency and improve code quality.

## Conventions
It is your responsibility not to diverge from existing conventions in the codebase. We ask that you write code that is similar to what already exists, and if you find a way to improve upon existing conventions, please do so in a separate pull request (PR). For example, if you want to change from using `onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)` to an `onlyAdmin` modifier, please do it all at once as a separate PR. This will allow us to evaluate and choose whether to adopt the new convention or stick with the old.

## Best Practices
We recommend that you study best practices. Some resources to consider include:

- [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/best-practices)
- [Entethalliance Security Levels Spec](https://entethalliance.github.io/eta-registry/security-levels-spec.html)

## Making Pull Requests
When making pull requests, we encourage you to create small, precise pull requests. This will make the review process easier and more efficient.
