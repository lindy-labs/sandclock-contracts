# Formal Verification of scWETHv2 Properties using hevm (Experimental)

This folder contains formal verification of scWETHv2 properties using the [hevm symbolic execution tool]([https://github.com/ethereum/hevm/releases/tag/release/0.51.0]).

The hevm tool does not support all features used in scWETHv2 and thus some adjustments were necessary:

* `scErrors.sol` needed to be removed as well as all its references in `scWETHv2.sol`, `OracleLib.sol`, `LendingMarketManager.sol`, and `scWETH2Helper.sol`;
* `scUSDC.sol` needed to be removed from the `forge build` compilation because the created json for an empty file (content is solely based on comments) cannot be processed by hevm (issue reported in its repo);
* Cheatcodes are not supported yet;
* `scWETHv2.sol` and `scWETHv2props.sol` needed to be adjusted on the `weth` state variable. For some reason, hevm does not support this constructor call `constructor(ConstructorParams memory params)
        sc4626(params.admin, params.keeper, ERC20(params.weth), "Sandclock WETH Vault v2", "scWETHv2")`, in particular this type cast `ERC20(params.weth)`.

Running hevm on `scWETHv2props.sol` results in:
